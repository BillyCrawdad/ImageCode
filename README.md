README Message Updated on November 30th, 2023

		Hey everyone, I started experimenting with using Python programming to make 
	PNG images, and I thought I'd share the code I'm using if anyone else is also
 	interested in creating PNG images using Python programming. I'm a bit of a novice at
	programming, so I admittedly used ChatGPT to help me learn computer programming
	using the Python programming language.

		Anyway, that's all I have to say for now, I hope this helps those who are
	trying to learn computer programming like I am.
